# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this used for?

I wanted an easy way to create a repository of Dockerfiles, and not only update
the base images when new hashes were available for a tag, but also to create new Dockerfiles
all-together when some new set of tags of interest were available. The result was this
small project. I plan to include other kinds of updates as needed (e.g., building many
containers from a matrix of options). 

## I have an idea for an updater!

Wonderful! This project is hopefully useful for someone other than myself, and if you
have an idea for how to make it better I want to hear from you! Please [get in contact with us](support).
