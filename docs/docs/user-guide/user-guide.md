# User's Guide
  
## How it works

This is a Go library that will look for `Dockerfile`s and (eventually) other assets
in your repository and help you keep this up to date (hence the name!) This means for:

 - A **Dockerfile** Updater: will look for all Dockerfiles, find `FROM` lines, and make sure we are using the most up to date hash. We do not advance the tag itself (e.g., 18.04 will not be updated to 20.04) but just the sha256 sum, in the case that there are security updates, etc.
 - A **Docker Hierarchy**: is a structure that has some top level folder identified by an `uptodate.yaml` file, which is described [here](https://vsoch.github.io/uptodate/docs/#/user-guide/user-guide?id=uptodate-yaml). Within this folder are subfolders that correspond to tags, and the tool looks for new tags, and generates you a template Dockerfile to build if there are. 
 - A **Dockerfile List**: updater will simply find all your Dockerfiles, and list them or provide them in a json output for a GitHub action for further parsing.
 - A **Docker Build**: provides a matrix of builds to pipe into a GitHub Action.
 
For all of the above, you can run the tool manually on the command line, or as a GitHub action.
For the last (Docker Build) the builds aren't currently performed for you (and you can [request this](https://github.com/vsoch/uptodate/issues) if you'd like it)
as it is expected to be run in a GitHub Workflow. With the GitHub action you can make workflows to check for updates at some frequency, and open a pull request with updates to test if/when a new version is found and a file is created or updated.


## Install

To install the library, first clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vsoch/uptodate
$ cd uptodate
```

You will need a recent version of Go on your path. And then to build the library:

```bash
$ make
```

This will create a binary executable, `uptodate` that you can use directly or
copy into a directory on your path. If you don't want to install, you can use
the set of [containers](https://github.com/vsoch/uptodate/pkgs/container/uptodate) available on GitHub packages, or the [GitHub Action](https://vsoch.github.io/uptodate/docs/#/user-guide/github-action).


## Commands

The following commands are available.

### Dockerfile

?> $ uptodate dockerfile

This command will read one or more Dockerfiles, and tell us if the digest is
up to date. When run by default, it will automatically update digests.

For example, to update a single Dockerfile, you would do:

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerfile /path/to/Dockerfile
              _            _       _       
  _   _ _ __ | |_ ___   __| | __ _| |_ ___ 
 | | | | '_ \| __/ _ \ / _  |/ _  | __/ _ \
 | |_| | |_) | || (_) | (_| | (_| | ||  __/
  \__,_| .__/ \__\___/ \__,_|\__,_|\__\___|
       |_|                     dockerfile


  ⭐️ Updated ⭐️
     Checked: 1
    Modified: 0
```

To update an entire directory of `Dockerfile`s:

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerfile /path/to/directory
```

Or just run without any arguments to parse the present working directory (recursively):

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerfile
```

If you don't want to write changes but just preview, add `--dry-run`:

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerhierarchy --dry-run
```

To update your `Dockerfile`s we use [lookout](https://github.com/alecbcs/lookout) for updated versions 


### Docker Hierarchy

?> $ uptodate dockerhierarchy


Have you ever noticed that when people maintain a repository of Dockerfile, they
tend to give it structure like:

```
container/
   tag1/
      Dockerfile
   tag2/
      Dockerfile
```

I have! And I think it makes sense to create a command alongside this tool that
can easily read that structure and then determine if there are new tags that we might want
to build. By default, we want the tool to automatically discover these organized hierarchies,
so we suggest adding an `uptodate.yaml` file to indicate a directory:

```
ubuntu/
   uptodate.yaml
   latest/
     Dockerfile
   20.04/
     Dockerfile
   18.04/
     Dockerfile
```

and then we would run the command to generate new tag subfolders and files!

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerhierarchy
              _            _       _       
  _   _ _ __ | |_ ___   __| | __ _| |_ ___ 
 | | | | '_ \| __/ _ \ / _  |/ _  | __/ _ \
 | |_| | |_) | || (_) | (_| | (_| | ||  __/
  \__,_| .__/ \__\___/ \__,_|\__,_|\__\___|
       |_|               dockerhierarchy

Copying /home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/ubuntu/20.04/Dockerfile to /home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/ubuntu/21.04/Dockerfile

  ⭐️ Updated ⭐️
     Updated versions for ubuntu: [21.04]
     Present versions for ubuntu: [16.04 18.04 20.04]
```

The tool will look for the `uptodate.yaml` and proceed to parse the directory when it finds one.
If you don't want to write new files, but rather preview what will be added, add `--dry-run`:

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerhierarchy --dry-run
```

#### Uptodate Yaml

The `uptodate.yaml` file's presence in a root (such as the relative path `./ubuntu` above)
indicates that the directory is structured like  a container URI, with tags as the subfolders. 
However, you are free to put other subfolders within the directory that don't correspond to tags, such
as matrix builds (described in a [following section](https://vsoch.github.io/uptodate/docs/#/user-guide/user-guide?id=docker-build)) that might use the image. For the above, running the dockerhierarchy updater will see there is an uptodate.yaml in
the folder, parse it, and then read the `dockerhierarchy` section and understand that the directory is ubuntu specific. It will
then derive all the existing tags for ubuntu (and by default use semver or semantic versioning
to decide whether to include tags) and create new Dockerfile folders for those that
are missing. The reason we need the `uptodate.yaml` is to store preference about
tags to skip, or more generally, a pattern to match. For containers with more complex
names that don't map nicely to a folder, we can just write it there. Here is an example,
with a few examples of filters you might use:

```yaml
container:
  name: ubuntu
  filter: 
    # Don't include anything that starts with arm
    - "^((?!arm).)*$"
    # include anything that starts with 3.9 (e.g., 3.9.1)
    - "3.9*"

  # The earliest version that should be used
  startat: 16.04

  # Skip these versions (e.g., not long term releases or LTS)
  skips:
    - "17.04"
    - "19.04"
```

Not including a filter defaults to looking for a numerical (something that has
a minor and major) version and something else. See the [version regex](/user-guide/user-guide?id=version-regular-expressions)
sections for more examples for your recipes. 

### Dockerfile List

?> $ uptodate dockerfilelist

If you want to just list Dockerfiles discovered, use:

```bash
$ ./uptodate dockerfilelist
/home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/Dockerfile
/home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/shpc/Dockerfile
/home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/shpc/Dockerfile.tcl
/home/vanessa/go/src/github.com/vsoch/uptodate/tests/ubuntu/21.04/Dockerfile
```

### Docker Build

Docker build will be similar to the Docker Hierarchy updater in that it reads an `uptodate.yaml`
and then generates one or more build matrices for it. The matrices include all versions or other variables
that you've specified, along with the Dockerfile that are discovered under the root where
the `uptodate.yaml` is. The matrices can be parsed into
a GitHub action to drive further container builds using one or more base images.
For example, let's say that we start with this configuration file:

```yaml
dockerbuild:
  build_args:
    # This is an example of a manual build arg, versions (or values) are required
    llvm_version:
      versions:
       - "4.0.0"
       - "5.0.1"
       - "6.0.0"

    # This is an example of a spack build arg, the name is the package
    abyss_version:
      name: abyss
      type: spack

    # This will be parsed by the Dockerfile parser, name is the container name
    ubuntu_version:
      name: ubuntu
      type: container
      startat: "16.04"
      filter: 
        - "^[0-9]+[.]04$" 
      skips:
      - "17.04"
      - "19.04"
```

You'll see the primary section of interest is under `dockerbuild`, and under this
we have theww build args. There are three `type` of build args:


 - *manual*: meaning you define a name and a list of versions or values, no extra parsing or updating done!
 - *spack*: derive a list of versions from spack, with the same options to start at, filter, skip, etc. The data is parsed from [the spack packages interface](https://spack.github.io/packages/) that is updated nightly from spack develop.
 - *container*: meaning you define similar fields to if you were asking to update Dockerfile froms - a container name, startat (version), filter, and versions to skip. If you include a tag with your container, we will simply update digests (and keep the same tag) so you'll get a much smaller matrix.
 

### GitHub Action

For all of the commands above, if you run them in a GitHub action, a matrix of results
will be produced that you can pipe into a build matrix, or parse as a string for your
own usage. See the [GitHub Action](https://vsoch.github.io/uptodate/docs/#/user-guide/github-action)
for more details.


### Version Regular Expressions

When selecting versions, you will need to customize your choice based on the container
or package of interest. Here is a long list of experiments for you to experiment with.
For all of the below, remove the `^` or `$` if you want to allow an additional prefix
or suffix, respectively. It's helpful to run the updates with `--dry-run` if you
just want to preview changes first.

```yaml
filter:

  # This is the default if you specify nothing
  - "[0-9]+[.][0-9]+(?:[.][0-9]+)?"

  # we only want XX.04 versions (e.g., ubuntu)
  - "^[0-9]+[.]04$"

  # we only want XX.XX versions
  - "^[0-9]+[.][0-9]+$"    

  # Don't include anything that starts with arm
  - "^((?!arm).)*$"

  # include anything that starts with 3.9 (e.g., 3.9.1)
  - "3.9*"
```
